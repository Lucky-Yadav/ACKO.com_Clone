            <h2>Why do you need two-wheeler/bike insurance?</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>The number of two-wheelers in India has grown rapidly in recent years. In the financial year 2021, two-wheeler sales in India were at 15.12 million units. With the high density of two-wheelers on the road, the possibility of accidents also increases. Maybe that is why Third-party Two-wheeler Insurance is mandatory by law. It covers you against damages to a third party two-wheeler/property or injury to the third party</p>
            <p>ACKO provides three types of two-wheeler insurance plans. The extensive Comprehensive Insurance, the standalone Third-party Insurance and the Own Damage Two-wheeler Insurance policies. The best part is that you can buy these three bike insurance plans online with zero paperwork.</p>

                <h2>Save costs</h2>

                <h2>Third-party Bike Insurance Plan</h2>
                <p>Third party Bike Insurance is mandatory in India. It protects you against financial liability if you accidentally damage someone else's vehicle or property or injure someone in an accident. However, it doesn't offer financial protection against damages or losses to your bike.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Comprehensive Bike Insurance Plan</h2>
                <p>A Comprehensive Bike Insurance covers everything that Third-party insurance covers, and also covers losses or damages to your two-wheeler in case of an accident, theft, fire, natural calamities (floods, earthquakes), riots, or strikes.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Personal Accident (PA) Cover</h2>
                <p>It is an additional cover to enhance your bike insurance plan. It is mandatory by law to own a PA Cover in India. While your 2 wheeler insurance policy covers damages to your bike, the PA Cover provides financial protection in the event of disability/death while riding a two-wheeler</p>
