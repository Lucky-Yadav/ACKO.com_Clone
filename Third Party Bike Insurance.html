                <p>Just as you make sure to buy the best motorcycle, scooter or even an electric scooter, you must also make sure that you protect your two-wheeler with bike insurance. As per The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, you must insure your vehicle at least with Third-party Bike Insurance. Failure to adhere to this mandatory requirement may result in penalties</p>
                <h2>What is Third-party Bike Insurance?</h2>
                <p>It is the most basic type of bike insurance that offers coverage against financial liabilities claimed by a third person. The third-party can raise a claim in case of damage to their vehicle or property or injury/death of the third party caused by an accident, where the insured (your) two-wheeler is at fault.</p>
                <h2>Importance</h2>
                <p>It is mandatory as per law, and if you are found riding the bike without this type of two-wheeler insurance policy, you could be liable for a penalty of Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 4,000 (subject to changes)</p>
                <h2>Why do you need Third-party Two-wheeler Insurance?</h2>
