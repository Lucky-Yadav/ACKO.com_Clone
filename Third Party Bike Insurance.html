                <p>Just as you make sure to buy the best motorcycle, scooter or even an electric scooter, you must also make sure that you protect your two-wheeler with bike insurance. As per The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, you must insure your vehicle at least with Third-party Bike Insurance. Failure to adhere to this mandatory requirement may result in penalties</p>
                <h2>What is Third-party Bike Insurance?</h2>
                <p>It is the most basic type of bike insurance that offers coverage against financial liabilities claimed by a third person.

                <h2>Importance</h2>
                <p>It is mandatory as per law, and if you are found riding the bike without this type of two-wheeler insurance policy, you could be liable for a penalty of Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 4,000 (subject to changes)</p>
                <h2>Why do you need Third-party Two-wheeler Insurance?</h2>

                <p>The high number of uninsured vehicles on the roads has prompted the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) to make bike insurance mandatory for all types of vehicles.</p>
                <p>When you buy a brand new bike, it is compulsory to insure your bike with a 5-year Third-party Liability Plan along with a 1-year Own Damage plan (5-years TP Plan + 1-year Own Damage Plan). You also have the option to buy a 5-year Own Damage Plan.</p>
                <p>Here are some of the advantages of long-term third-party bike insurance.</p>

                <p>The Third-party Bike Insurance price is fixed by the IRDAI and not by the insurer (ACKO in this case). The cost is based on the cubic capacity of the bike’s engine. The regulator revises the Third-party Two-wheeler Insurance premium rates periodically. </p>

            <div class="middle"><h2>Factors that affect Third-party Two-wheeler Insurance premium</h2></div>
            <div>
                <p>The Comprehensive Bike Insurance Policy considers various factors such as the year of manufacture, the Insured Declared Value (IDV), and the vehicle model to determine insurance cost. However, the Third-party Two-wheeler Insurance Policy considers only a single factor while determining the vehicle's insurance cost which is the engine cubic capacity.</p>
                <p>The cost of a Comprehensive Policy is calculated by ACKO, while the IRDAI determines the price of a Third-party Policy. The apex body fixes the rates based on the engine cubic capacity.</p>

                <h2>Which policy is better, Comprehensive or Third-party Bike Insurance?</h2>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>An ideal approach to determine which is the best policy for your bike is to compare them based on the coverage and premium</p>
                <p> <b>Coverage</b> </p>
                <p>Third-party Insurance for your bike is compulsory as per The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. However, it does not provide financial coverage in case of damages to your bike. The Comprehensive Bike Insurance Policy offers wide coverage since it provides financial coverage for both third-party liabilities and damages to your vehicle</p>
                <p><b>Premium</b></p>
                <p>The Third-party Insurance price is lower than the Comprehensive Bike Insurance Plan as the coverage is limited to third-party liabilities. As in the case of the Comprehensive insurance plan for bikes, it offers basic financial coverage for your bike, and it also has the option to enhance the coverage by including relevant add-on covers. </p>
